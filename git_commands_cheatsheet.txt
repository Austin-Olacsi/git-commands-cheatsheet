Setting up git for the first time:

find your github email at https://github.com/settings/emails and enter this stuff:
git config --global user.email "GITHUB-EMAIL" (email that i use ends with @users.noreply.github.com)
git config --global user.name "GITHUB-USERNAME"


Making a branch and adding a commit:
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git (obviousy this should be your own fork of a project)
cd into the folder!
create branch: git checkout -b branch-name
Then, make your changes to the code!
git add .
git commit -am "[fix] fixes a bug" (obviously this is the title of your commit)
optionaly, type: git status
git push origin brach-name

enter your github username when prompted
for the password use your access token, see this guide to get one: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens
use this token when git prompts you for your password! The password you use on the github login page doesn't work!


Squashing commits:
usefull video guide - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viY1BbKZhSI

first, set our git editor to nano to make things easier:
export GIT_EDITOR="nano"
export EDITOR="nano"
echo 'export GIT_EDITOR="nano"' >> ~/.bashrc
and restart terminal or run source ~/.bashrc


git switch branch-name
git rebase -i HEAD~18
(that number should be the number of commits you've made in total)

now change 'pick' to 's' for all the commits except the first one
when you save and exit, it will open the next file- you need to remove all commit messages except the first one

git push origin branch-name -f
